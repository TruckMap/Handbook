# TruckMap Employee Handbook

## Preamble

At TruckMap we like to be agile and pragmatic about everything we do. In that spirit, our handbook lays out our values and guiding principles (and a small number of progressive policies) -- in an open-source document that’s easy to read and understand. Because it’s hosted in a public GitHub repo, anyone can view how it changes over time and submit pull requests to update it.

## What We Believe
#### At TruckMap, we believe...
 * Success in business is determined by **people**, **working in teams**, to **solve novel problems**.
 * The era of rote and repetitive work is at an end. The jobs of today (& tomorrow) require:
   * Collaboration, to leverage unique perspectives and expertise across domains.
   * Creativity, to find novel solutions to difficult problems.
   * Responsiveness, to adapt to rapidly changing landscape of technologies, customers, and competitors.
 * The way we work must change radically. Current "best practices" are designed for jobs that no longer exist.

#### This belief inspires us to...
 * Maximize the conditions for collaboration, creativity, and responsiveness:
   * Purpose - the sense that your job is important and you are having an impact
   * Transparency - easy access to information about your team's goals and performance
   * Feedback - on your performance so that you can learn and improve
   * Community - the bond you share with colleagues as you strive toward common goals
   * Empowerment - the confidence and autonomy to experiment, learn, and then take action

#### We work toward a future in which...
 * Autonomy & ownership is maximized.
 * Information is explicit and shared, never hoarded.
 * Employees are encouraged to experiment, learn, and act.

## Values
Our values [aren’t just nice-sounding words on a poster](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/3-Seven_Aspects_of_our_Culture) somewhere, but a succinct description of our culture and what it’s like to work here. We use these values to guide our day-to-day activities and decision-making, from how we respond to customer emails to the roles we hire for to the features we build.

* [Go get results](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#go-get-results)
* [Be an excellent teammate](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#be-an-excellent-teammate)
* [Default to transparency](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#default-to-transparency)
* [Work smarter](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#work-smarter)
* [Seek and embrace diversity](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#seek-and-embrace-diversity)
* [Delight the customer](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#delight-the-customer)

### Go get results

Embodying this value means:
* Bias toward action
* Try things that might not work
* Focus on results, not inputs
* Release, iterate, improve
* Take responsibility for understanding context and goals

You can think of this value in two parts: “go get” and “results”. The first part speaks to our strong bias toward action. If there’s something you want to make, improve, change, or get rid of -- go do it. Need input or feedback? Chat with some colleagues on Slack. Need copywriting, engineering or design resources? Recruit those colleagues by rallying them to your cause. Whatever you do, avoid what [Netflix calls](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664/11-11_Impact_You_accomplish_amazing) “analysis paralysis”.

The second part (“results”) speaks to the primacy of outputs. We care about inputs to the extent that we want to [Work smarter](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#work-smarter) and be finding more efficient, effective ways to produce better outputs. Beyond that, what matters is getting the work done and measuring the impact of this work after completing it. Do the results match up with your goals? Is there more room for improvement? Were there unintended consequences (good or bad)?

In practice, this is challenging. In order to go get results, we must understand current goals and priorities, and cost/benefit tradeoffs (ie. go for the quick win that costs little, or spend more time on a robust solution?). Our core value of [Default to transparency](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#default-to-transparency) should ensure that the information you need is available to you, but if it isn't, go seek it out.

### Be an excellent teammate

Embodying this value means:
* Be proactive and assertive
* Solicit feedback and input
* Be [radically candid](https://www.radicalcandor.com/about-radical-candor/)
* Listen first
* Assume the best
* Be there for others
* Teach & encourage
* Solve problems together

We believe that success is achieved by people working on teams. As such, it is critical that we be the best teammates possible to one another. This means being proactive and assertive in your communication: asking for what you need, providing candid, constructive feedback, and voicing your opinions and ideas. It also means listening to, supporting, and encouraging your colleagues -- especially at times of disagreement and stress. And last but not least, it means having fun with your teammates!

### Default to transparency

Embodying this value means:
* Take responsibility to share information that may help others (with context)
* Share what you’ve learned
* Be vulnerable - talk about mistakes, failures, and bad news
* Create an environment where it’s easy to get information

(We took this phrasing from [Buffer](https://open.bufferapp.com/buffer-values/). Thanks, Buffer.)

In order to act on our values, particularly those of [Work smarter](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#work-smarter) and [Go get results](https://github.com/TruckMap/Handbook#go-get-results), individuals must be equipped with the information they need to make good decisions. That information consists of metrics, results and other data, as well as the contextual information to help them understand that data and use it to make good decisions.

On an individual level, we candidly share stories of our successes, failures, challenges, and interests so that we can learn from and support one another.

In discussing this value, there was some concern that "default" made it sound too passive but we ultimately came to feel that "default" is the appropriate word. As dedicated product people, we understand the power of defaults. To make something the default means that people will always do that thing, _unless there is a very compelling reason not to_. We understand that some information must be kept confidential or compartmentalized. But this value ensures that sharing is the rule, concealing is the exception.

### Work smarter

Embodying this value means:
* Question why/how we do things
* Iterate on current processes
* Optimize how you work
* Always be learning
* Make data-informed decisions (when possible)
* Figure out how we can "punch above our weight"
* Embrace & learn from negative results

At TruckMap, we’re able to move quickly and effectively with a very small team by ensuring that every team member is not simply executing on tactical-level tasks, but is also evaluating, improving, (and ideally automating) how those tasks get executed. Moreover, team members are encouraged to question if specific tasks are even necessary, and seek [growth via subtraction](https://medium.com/@SubtractionCap/subtraction-growth-6ef5c8ad42f6).

Working smarter also means knowing yourself and how you work best. Where do you work best? With what tools? At what times? How much R&R do you need in order to perform at your best? What skills/knowledge do you need to acquire in order to take your output to the next level? At TruckMap, you have the freedom, and the responsibility, to answer these questions for yourself.

### Seek and embrace diversity

Embodying this value means:
* Actively learn about and work to mitigate your own biases
* Make sure our product is inclusive
* Seek representation & inclusion (even at the expense of other goals)
* Build inclusivity & bias mitigation into our processes
* Expect it to be hard and uncomfortable sometimes

Our industry has [well-documented](http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/20/9179853/tech-diversity-scorecard-apple-google-microsoft-facebook-intel-twitter-amazon) [problems](http://wpusa.org/WPUSA_TechsDiversityProblem.pdf) when it comes to [workplace diversity](http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/28/what-a-truly-diverse-tech-company-would-look-like/). This fact makes it easy for tech companies to skew everything from their employment policies to the features they develop toward the needs of the dominant group - which is both a disservice to our customers and reinforces the lack of diversity in our industry.

Our dedication to diversity goes beyond simply putting equal opportunity copy on our job descriptions. We use tools (like [Textio](https://textio.com/)) to eliminate gender bias from the language of our job postings, and actively seek out applicants from diverse backgrounds. And we invite feedback from job applicants and employees alike about how we can better embrace diversity. We all have [unconscious biases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLjFTHTgEVU) and welcome your help in identifying and mitigating them.

On an individual level, employees help create an inclusive and welcoming environment first by learning about how privilege and bias can work to exclude certain voices in the workplace. For example, [meetings are often a situation in which women, minorities, and people with reserved personalities struggle to be heard](https://hbr.org/2014/06/women-find-your-voice). If you are someone who feels comfortable and confident in meetings and usually speaks early and often, try asking for input from your colleagues before giving your opinion. Encourage others who do speak up by practicing active listening and thanking them for their input.

On a product level, we strive to build software tools that are inclusive and welcoming to all and will hold ourselves accountable for how our product is used by our customers.

### Delight the customer

Embodying this value means:
* Provide a delightful experience
* Make it simple, helpful, and reliable
* Deliver value over the long term
* Take time to listen to and empathize with the customer
* Be accountable for how people experience our product and company

This is a value as old as business itself, but it’s fundamental to how we operate at TruckMap. We are a business, and the only way we can stay in business is by attracting and retaining customers.

From the very start of TruckMap, we've focused on building a product that our customers find simple, helpful, and reliable.

To that end, everyone at TruckMap focuses on the customer -- their needs, challenges, feedback, ideas, and behaviors. This focus is foundational to everything we do because we don’t just serve customers -- we delight them.

## Time Off
### Vacation
We want you to take the time you need to refresh and recharge. Many startups offer a simple “unlimited vacation” policy. We view this as lazy policymaking at best and at worst an attempt to subtly [discourage employees from taking vacation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1434/1*fompXsY2010uPRkG1poa-g.png).

Instead, we set a minimum expected vacation. Our expectation is that everyone (including founders and early hires) will take a **minimum of 2 weeks** (10 days) vacation per year. If you have taken less than two weeks of vacation in a calendar year, expect your manager to talk to you about it.

Can you truly take "unlimited" vacation? Of course not. You can't expect to take 6 months of paid vacation per year. But, there is also not a hard limit on the number of days off per year that you can take. Between longer vacations and random days off here and there, a typical employee will take off a few weeks per year. Can you take more than that? Sure, but we'd recommend having a conversation with your manager about it ahead of time.

TruckMap observes all [US federal holidays](https://www.federalpay.org/holidays), plus the day after Thanksgiving.

### Parental Leave
One important policy that many early-stage startups ignore is parental leave. We believe that having a great parental leave plan is critical to attracting and retaining top talent who are parents or want to become parents. Parental leave is for any kind of parent, mother or father, by birth, adoption, or surrogacy.

We offer 9 weeks paid parental leave, to be taken anytime during your child's first 6 months with you. This is less than we would like, so as we grow we'll increase the amount of paid leave.

## Policies
### At-Will Employment Policy

Your employment with TruckMap is at will. This means that you are free to terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause and the company has a right to terminate your employment at any time as well, with or without cause. No one in the company other than the CEO has the authority to alter your at-will status or to enter into any agreement for employment for a specified period of time or to make any agreement contrary to this policy. Only the CEO may do so, and only in a written agreement signed by both the CEO and you.
